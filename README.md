# CacophinChess
UCI-compatible chess engine written in Java

Acting on everything I learned from my other chess engine "Quiet Intrigue". Starting out with the following from the ground up:
* Bitboards
* Transposition tables
* UCI compatibility

I'm also more experienced now and using much more sane design decisions and architecture.

This should allow me to plug and play with other chess engines, GUI frameworks and other automation projects I've been interested in.

I'll update this as I develop the engine and add features!
